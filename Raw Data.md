### Default port assignments

When Elasticsearch or Fleet Server are deployed, components communicate over well-defined, pre-allocated ports. You may need to allow access to these ports. Refer to the following table for default port assignments:

|Component communication|Default port|
|:--|:--|
|Elastic Agent → Fleet Server|8220|
|Elastic Agent → Elasticsearch|9200|
|Elastic Agent → Logstash|5044|
|Elastic Agent → Kibana (Fleet)|5601|
|Fleet Server → Kibana (Fleet)|5601|
|Fleet Server → Elasticsearch|9200|
