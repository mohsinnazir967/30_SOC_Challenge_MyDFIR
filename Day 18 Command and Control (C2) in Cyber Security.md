**Mythic:**

- **Usage**: Used in the 30-day challenge.
- **Build**: Golang, Docker, Docker Compose, web browser UI.
- **Features**: Tracks payloads and C2 profiles, supports 21 different agents.

## 5. Next Steps

**Tasks**:

- Craft an attack on a Windows server.
- Set up a Mythic server.
- Deploy an agent to establish a successful C2 session.
